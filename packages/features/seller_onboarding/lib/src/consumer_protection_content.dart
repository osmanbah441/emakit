Mooemart Consumer Protection Policy

Effective Date: July 17, 2025

This Consumer Protection Policy outlines Mooemart's commitment to protecting the rights and interests of consumers (buyers) using our platform, in compliance with the Consumer Protection Act, 2020 of Sierra Leone and other relevant laws. As a marketplace, [Your Company Name] facilitates transactions between independent sellers and buyers. While sellers are primarily responsible for meeting their obligations to consumers, we are committed to providing a fair, transparent, and trustworthy environment.

1. Our Role as a Platform
    1.1. Mooemart acts as an intermediary, providing a platform for sellers to list and sell their products/services and for buyers to discover and purchase them. We do not directly sell goods or services ourselves unless expressly stated.
    1.2. We are committed to fostering a marketplace where consumers can shop with confidence, knowing their rights are respected.

2. Consumer Rights (as per Consumer Protection Act, 2020)
    We strive to ensure that transactions on our Platform uphold the fundamental consumer rights enshrined in Sierra Leonean law, including:
    Right to Safety: Consumers have the right to be protected against the marketing of goods or provision of services that are hazardous to life and property.
    Right to Information: Consumers have the right to be informed about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard, and price of goods or services, to protect them against unfair trade practices.
    Right to Choice: Consumers have the right to access a variety of goods and services at competitive prices.
    Right to be Heard: Consumers have the right to have their interests considered and represented in relevant forums.
    Right to Redress: Consumers have the right to seek redress against unfair trade practices or unscrupulous exploitation, including the right to fair settlement of legitimate complaints.
    Right to Consumer Education: Consumers have the right to acquire knowledge and skills to make informed choices.

3. Seller Obligations Regarding Consumer Protection
    3.1. Accurate Listings: Sellers are required to provide accurate, truthful, and complete descriptions of their products/services, including price, condition, and any potential defects or limitations. Misleading representations are strictly prohibited.
    3.2. Quality and Fitness for Purpose: Products sold by sellers must be of merchantable quality, fit for the purpose for which they are generally intended, and free from defects, as expected by a reasonable consumer.
    3.3. Fair Pricing: Sellers must clearly state the full price of items, including any applicable taxes or charges. Hidden fees are not permitted.
    3.4. Delivery and Fulfillment: Sellers are obligated to deliver goods or provide services as advertised and within the agreed-upon timeframe. Non-delivery, undue delays, or delivery of incorrect items are serious violations.
    3.5. Returns and Refunds: Sellers must have and adhere to clear return and refund policies that comply with the Consumer Protection Act, 2020. This includes facilitating returns for defective goods or services not conforming to their description.
    3.6. Customer Service: Sellers are expected to communicate respectfully and promptly with buyers to address inquiries and resolve issues.

4. Dispute Resolution for Consumers
    4.1. Initial Resolution: We encourage buyers to first attempt to resolve any issues directly with the seller through the Platform's messaging system.
    4.2. Platform Assistance: If a resolution cannot be reached between the buyer and seller, Mooemart provides a mechanism for buyers to report disputes. Our team will review the dispute based on evidence provided by both parties and our policies.
    4.3. Our Decision: While we act as a facilitator, our decision in resolving platform-level disputes (e.g., requiring a refund or replacement) will be based on fairness, evidence, and compliance with our policies and the spirit of the Consumer Protection Act, 2020. Our decision may be binding on sellers within the confines of our terms.
    4.4. External Redress: Consumers retain their right to seek redress through the National Consumer Protection Commission of Sierra Leone or other relevant legal avenues if they are not satisfied with the resolution provided on the Platform.

5. Prohibited Practices on the Platform
    We strictly prohibit sellers from engaging in practices considered unfair or misleading under the Consumer Protection Act, 2020, including but not limited to:
    False or misleading representations about goods or services.
    Bait advertising.
    Wrongly accepting payment for goods or services not intended to be supplied.
    Assertion of a right to payment for unsolicited goods or services.
    Pyramid selling schemes.
    Harassment or coercion of consumers.
